## The Electric Corvette

I have always been a tinkerer. I have always enjoyed a project. I am concerned about our over reliance on fossil fuels and the impact of that on the world we leave behind when were gone. I love corvettes. I think that is why I have found my self at this project.

### The mission of this project is to make a performant and decently ranged electric vehicle out of my 1978 Chevrolet Corvette

### The Car

The car is a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette former pace car. It came stock with a small-block 350 with a 8.2:1 compression ratio. It has a torque rating of 280 lb-ft @ 2400 rpm and a curb weight of 3,529 lb.
